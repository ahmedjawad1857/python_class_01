## Running a "Hello World" Program

You can run a simple "Hello World" program to ensure that your Python setup is working as expected.

### Using Anaconda Prompt on Windows

1. Open Anaconda prompt
2. Run the following Python command:

   ```bash
   python -c "print('Hello world')"
   ```

### Using VS Code (.py file)

1. Open VS Code and create a new Python file called `class1.py`.
2. Write the following Python code:

   ```python
   print("Hello world")
   ```

3. Install the Python extension for VS Code if you haven't done so.
4. Click on the Run button to execute the code.

### Using VS Code (.ipynb file)

1. Open VS Code and create a new Jupyter Notebook called `class1.ipynb`.
2. Insert the following Python code into a new cell:

   ```python
   print("Hello world")
   ```

3. Click on the Run button to execute the cell.

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment

### Creating a New Environment

1. Run the following command to create a new Conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n <env_name> python==3.12 -y
   # Example: conda create -n python12 python==3.12 -y
   ```

2. Activate your newly created environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate <env_name>
   # Example: conda activate python12
   ```

### Installing Required Packages

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

   ```
   mypy
   ```

2. Run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Selecting the Environment in VS Code

1. Open `fileName.py` in VS Code.
2. Select your virtual environment 

### Selecting the Environment in Jupyter Notebook

1. Open `fileName.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Select your virtual environment
